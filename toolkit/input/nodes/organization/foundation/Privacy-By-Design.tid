IRMA offers a way for privacy-friendly authentication. When authenticating, you as a user reveal only relevant properties (attributes) of yourself, using an IRMA app on your mobile phone â€” for instance that you are older than 16. In addition, with this app you can also digitally sign messages, where you identify yourself as a signer also with personal attributes. In this way you can sign for instance with your name and address, or with your medical registration, when you are a doctor, or just with your email address if you do not wish to disclose anything else.
