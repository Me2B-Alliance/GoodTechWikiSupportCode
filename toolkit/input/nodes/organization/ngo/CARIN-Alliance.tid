Our vision is to rapidly advance the ability for consumers and their authorized caregivers to easily get: use: and share their digital health information when: where: and how they want to achieve their goals. Specifically: we are promoting the ability for consumers and their authorized caregivers to gain digital access to their health information via non-proprietary application programming interfaces or APIs. We envision a future where any consumer can choose any application to retrieve both their complete health record and their complete coverage information from any provider or plan in the country.
