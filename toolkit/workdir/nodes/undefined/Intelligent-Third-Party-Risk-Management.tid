Your vendors often handle your most sensitive data. This presents security and privacy challenges as third-party risk teams like yours struggle to vet and manage the vendors you rely on most. OneTrust Vendorpedia adds value to your vendor inventory, enabling faster assessment with risk mitigation workflows, ongoing monitoring, and powerful reporting to manage the entire vendor engagement lifecycle, from onboarding to offboarding.
