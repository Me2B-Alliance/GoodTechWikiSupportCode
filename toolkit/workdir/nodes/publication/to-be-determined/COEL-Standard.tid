Coelition has driven the creation of the COEL Standard to provide interoperability, transparency and open access.

The COEL Standard specification development is managed with the OASIS framework (www.oasis-open.org/committees/coel/). OASIS is a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence and adoption of open standards for the global information society.

The COEL specifications provide interoperability at the data layer with a knowledge base and data model. The roles and responsibilities of all the different actors are clearly defined alongside the data flows. It sets out the minimum requirements for a safe, operational ecosystem â€“ leaving as much room as possible for innovation and competition. Finally, it is an interface specification that only defines how data is to be exchanged.
