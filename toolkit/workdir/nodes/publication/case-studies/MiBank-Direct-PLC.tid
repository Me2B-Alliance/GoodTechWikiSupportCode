Coelition can help individuals to identify how their behaviours impact themselves and society.

We all create distinct patterns when we interact with large service infrastructures - financial, transport, retail and communications. These patterns are used to predict our behaviours but are not visible to us as individuals.

A hypothetical financial institution, MiBank Direct PLC, has deep understanding of how current spending behaviour maps to future financial status for their internal risk management processes. They decide to generate new data structures that show customersâ€™ interactions without the financial details.

These are used to provide innovative consumer-centric services, developing a dialogue where customers can see how their behaviours compare to others and contribute to different financial outcomes.
