Advances in technology are creating data at unprecedented levels of detail and speed, turning the stories of peopleâ€™s lives into numbers every minute of every day, across the globe. The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data was established to help stakeholders across countries and sectors fully harness the data revolution for sustainable development, using this new knowledge to improve lives and protect the planet. The Global Partnership is a growing network of hundreds of members, including governments, the private sector, civil society, international organizations, academic institutions, foundations, statistics agencies, and other data communities.
